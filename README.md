# Hand
Can you please just let Hand rest? It's done too much harm to me and I want it gone after it is acquired by MeowBlocks.
I don't want anyone forking or remaking the mod. There is never going to be updates to Hand, and all the blocks in the Hand topic are being thrown away.
Please understand that I just want the topic over. It's been way too taxing in my mind and I want it to get as far as I can. -Blakedows2001
